# jQuery Name Generator

This project was designed to help me build a basic understanding of jQuery.

Inside a javascript there are three arrays:
1. Male Names
2. Female Names
3. Last Names

When the button inside the html is clicked, jquery will run a function to generate a gender and name to be displayed in the html.
